"""tenants: add org profile fields (logo, description, location, contact)

Revision ID: 0015
Revises: 0014
Create Date: 2026-08-25

Logo is stored as a plain URL (org admin pastes a hosted image link)
rather than a new upload/storage pipeline — kept deliberately simple for
now; revisit if org admins need us to host the file.

NEUTERED 2026-08-26: this migration's schema changes are now
folded into 0001's create_all() (models.py already reflects them),
and any RLS policy work here is superseded by 0001's consolidated
policy setup. Any data backfill above only ever mattered for rows
that existed in this project's own dev database at the time it was
first applied there (already done, permanently) — a fresh install
has no such rows to backfill. Kept as a no-op, not deleted, so the
revision chain and this history stay intact. See 0001's docstring.
